# Unit Testing Study Project

This project is designed to help study and practice unit testing in JavaScript. It includes:

- `sum(a, b)`: A simple function that returns the sum of two numbers.
- `derivative(f, x, h)`: A function that calculates the numerical derivative of a given mathematical function `f` at point `x` using the central difference method.

The repository contains sophisticated unit tests covering edge cases, invalid inputs, and mathematical validations for both functions.
